# calculator
The goal of this program is to be an all-round calculator based on console-input, which means that it is designed to function without a graphical interface. It does however support the implementation of an interface. Some of the calculator's features are:
  - Basic operations like addition, multiplication, subtraction and division of numbers, vectors and matrices.
  - Several mathematical objects like real or complex numbers, vectors, matrices, functions and expressions.
  - Declaring and storing variables.
  - Multiple mathematical functions such as trigonometric functions (and their inverse and hyperbolic versions) or the exponential, logarithm, square root, absolute value, factorial and complex conjugate.
  - Several algorithms, including the ABC-formula, matrix row-reduction and decomposition, derivation and integration and some algebraic simplifying algorithms.
  - (Recursive) sequences
  - A collection of physical constants.
  
  For details, look at the [documentation PDF](documentation.pdf) (which is admittedly a bit outdated). Suggestions and bug reports are always welcome!
  
## Features to come
  - A method for evaluating expression using the Einstein sum convention
  - Better numerical integration
  - Better simplification of functions
