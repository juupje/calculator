# calculator
The goal of this program is to be an all-round calculator based on console-input, which means that it is designed to function without a graphical interface. It does however support the implementation of an interface. Some of the calculator's features are:
  - Basic operations like addition, multiplication, subtraction and division of numbers, vectors and matrices.
  - Several mathematical objects like real or complex numbers, vectors, matrices, functions and expressions.
  - Declaring and storing variables.
  - Multiple mathematical functions such as trigonometric functions (and their inverse and hyperbolic versions) or the exponential, logarithm, square root, absolute value, factorial and complex conjugate.
  - Several algorithms, including the ABC-formula, matrix row-reduction and decomposition, derivation and integration and some algebraic simplifying algorithms.
  - (Recursive) sequences
  - A function to evaluate expressions which use the einstein summation convention for indexed objects (like matrices or vectors)
  - Various methods to output object to LaTeX codes, to generate the computational graphs of expressions and functions using GraphViz's Dot language, and to save/restore sessions or specific variables
  - A help function which shows the syntax of available commands and what those commands compute
  - A simple API system which allows users to add plugins (see my [TeXer](https://github.com/juupje/TeXer) and [Plotter](https://github.com/juupje/Plotter projects))
  - A collection of physical constants.
 
  For details, look at the [documentation PDF](documentation.pdf) (which is admittedly a bit outdated). Suggestions and bug reports are always welcome!
  
## Features to come
  - Better numerical integration
  - Better simplification of functions
  - A GUI
